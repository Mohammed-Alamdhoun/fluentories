                <p style="text-align: left;">
                    Fluentory is a skills-focused language platform built to boost real-world confidence through
                    practical, grammar-light learning. Founded in Amman in 2020, it offers personalized coaching, resume
                    support, mock interviews, and more, all designed to prepare learners for global success. While we
                    began with Business English, Fluentories is expanding to include other languages soon, because
                    communication shouldn't have borders.
